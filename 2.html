        <h2>About the Vaquita</h2>
        <img src="image/1.jpeg" alt="Vaquita Image 1">
        <p>The vaquita, also known as Phocoena sinus, is the world's most endangered marine mammal, with current estimates suggesting fewer than ten individuals remain in the wild. This small porpoise is known for its elusive nature and resides solely in the northern part of the Gulf of California, Mexico. The vaquita's decline is primarily due to bycatch in illegal gillnets used for capturing the totoaba fish, whose bladder is highly valued on the black market.</p>
        <p>The vaquita is a critical part of the marine ecosystem, and its extinction would signify a tragic loss of biodiversity. </p>
