    <p>Heart health: A 2020 study found that apples can reduce total cholesterol levels and improve blood flow in people with high cholesterol. The fiber in apples, especially pectin, binds to cholesterol in the digestive tract and flushes it out.
Cancer prevention: The antioxidants and phytochemicals in apples may protect cell DNA from oxidative damage, which can lead to cancer. Animal and cell studies have found that these chemicals can prevent new cancer cells from growing and the spread of existing cancer cells.
Weight loss: Apples are low in calories, contain fiber, and are naturally sweet, which can promote satiety and help ward off cravings for sweets.
